        <h3>Air Fryer Potato Wedges</h3>

        <p>Potato! It's great! Have some for fuel as a pre workout snack due to its carb count or as a side dish
            for those who need to meet a specific calorie count. However, don't just bite into it, ya meat head!
            With just a little bit of slicing, seasoning, and chucking them in an air fryer, you could have
            one of the best tasting foods this planet has to offer!
