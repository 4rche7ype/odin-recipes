        <h3>A Simple Chicken Salad?</h3>

        <p>Yeah, that's right! You want to be shredded? Guess what, so does your chicken! Your chicken for your salad, that is. Chicken, as you
            can probably tell by now, is one of the preffered ways to get in your protein. Using your left overs from other recipes,
            you can create another delicious meal and get in that protein necessary to keep you shredded.
        </p>

        <p>This is also a very simple dish that takes minimal effort, a theme we like to keep here, but provides variation to your daily protein 
            consumption. There is a lot of things you can add or remove to your liking or nutritional goals making it a very versatile and worthy dish.
